/* netcard.c: this is a simple custom ethernet adapter interface for Faux86.
   it's not modeled after a real-world ethernet adapter, thus i had to create
   own DOS packet driver for programs to make use of it. this packet driver
   is included with this source code, in the data/ directory. the filename is
   pd.com - inject this file into any floppy or hard disk image if needed! */
